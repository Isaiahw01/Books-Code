# Books-Code


## Description

This is a MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) application that searches Google Books for a given book title, then displays the results. It has a user login function that then provides a method to save desired book titles from the search results to the logged in user's account. The internal database API functions are provided through a GraphQL API using Apollo Server. Security for app is provided by JSON Web Tokens and the `jwt-decode` module for the client side.
